    <h2> About me!</h2>
    <p> I love technology. When I was around 7 years old I learned how to run MS-DOS for my dad,
        so that I could watch him play doom. I spend alot of time playing video games, listening
        to music and hanging out with my girlfriend and our three dogs. Oh and im a total movie nerd.<br>
